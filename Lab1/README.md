- Lab 1 - E

    **Programming assignments for grade E**:

    1. In C implement a recursive and an iterative version of a function which reads characters from stdin until a newline character is read and then prints them on stdout in reverse order. Hint: use getchar(), putchar() (or getc(), putc()). For the iterative version you may assume a fixed max length of the input.
        - [x]  
    2. Implement the above program in JAVA using one of the ADTs suggested in Algorithms ch. 1.3.
        - [x]  
    3. Implement a generic iterable FIFO-queue based on a double linked circular list. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element.
        - [x]  
    4. Implement a generic iterable circular linked list which allows the user to insert and remove elements to/from the front and back end of the queue. Be careful when designing the API. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element.
        - [x]  
    5. Implement a generalized queue which allows the user to remove the *k*th element from the queue. Assume the most recently added element has index 1. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element.
        - [x]  
    6. Implement an ordered queue based on one of the implementations above. The elements stored in the queue should be integer values. The elements should be ordered at insertion so that all elements are stored in ascending order starting from when you insert the first element and in all following insertions. You should print the content of the list after each insertion/deletion of an element.
        - [x]  

- Lab 1 - Higher Grades

    **Higher grade problem**

    **Note:** You should have solved all grade E problems and successfully presented the problems if you have been selected at the seminar to be able to account this problem

    Implement a program which takes as input a series of parentheses , that is a series of the characters: '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'. The program should check if the parentheses are "balanced" or not. Also show the time and memory complexity of the algorithm.

    Upload code, tests and a text motivating your choice of algorithm and how you have calculated the complexities.
