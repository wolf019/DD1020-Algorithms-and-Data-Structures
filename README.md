# DD1020-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-

##On completion of the course, students should be able to

- describe a number of common algorithms for search and sorting and their properties
- compare algorithms with regard to time and memory usage
- implement data structures as linear lists stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree and search trees
- bidentify problems where the data structures above are useful and design simple algorithms with these
- write programmes that use algorithms and data structures by means of good programming principles such as systematic tests and abstraction
- model problems as search problems and implement algorithms for breadth-first-search, depth-first-search or best-first-search
 
## in order to

- be able to design programmes that solve problems by using commonly occurring algorithms and data structures
- acquire sufficient prior knowledge to be able to take advanced courses in computer science.
